    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>A traditional lasagna, with about half 
        the time and effort! I always cook extra 
        to have leftovers, but the more I cook, 
        the more they eat! Serve with garlic toast and salad. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Following we have listed the ingredients required for the dish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beed</li>
        <li>1 pound italian sausages</li>
        <li>Half cup water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tabelspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>8 ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>14 ounce marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet 
            over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. Stir in the water 
            and black olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, 
            sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 
            15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and 
            remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13
             inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread 
             a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle 
             with a little mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of 
             sauce, and repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on 
             top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30
             minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked
              when you can easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved
               cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes
                for a nice melted cheese topping.</li>
        <li>Cut into slices and enjoy it.</li>
